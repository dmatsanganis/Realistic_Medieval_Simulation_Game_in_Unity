# Realistic Medieval Simulation Game in Unity

This project constitutes an immersive medieval simulation game, meticulously developed in the Unity environment. The overarching goal was to construct an authentic medieval village setting, thereby offering players an unprecedented opportunity to experience life as a knight in the Middle Ages.

The key technologies and features integrated into the game are as follows:

1. Cinemachine:
Cinemachine, Unity's suite of cinematic tools, was extensively utilized to create dynamic, gameplay-integrated cameras. This resulted in a highly immersive user experience, with seamless transitions and intuitive camera controls.

2. Third Person Controller:
The implementation of a robust third-person controller provides players with a natural, responsive interaction mechanism. This feature allows for a wide range of movements, enhancing the player's engagement and immersion in the game world.

3. Advanced Animation Techniques:
A multitude of animations was incorporated to add depth and realism to the characters and environment. These animations span from simple character movements to complex environmental dynamics, each contributing to the overall lifelike feel of the game.

4. AI Agents:
Artificial Intelligence agents were integrated to simulate non-playable characters (NPCs) within the game. These AI agents have been programmed to interact realistically with the environment and respond to the player's actions, thereby creating a rich, interactive game world.

Through the combination of these advanced technologies and design principles, the project offers a highly engaging and realistic medieval gaming experience.
