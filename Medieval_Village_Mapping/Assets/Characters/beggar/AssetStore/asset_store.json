	"description": "This pack contains a medieval character picturing a poor guy. Animations are made to let him be a farmer, a tavern barkeeper, a smith, a beggar or a priest. There are 2 different heads and different tools like a hammer or a a brush. There is an optional cloak and he can have hairs or be bold to create even more variations.\n<br><br>\nAnimations are splitted. So it is possible to start each sequence separated like:<br>\nanimation.Play(\"Walk\");\n<br><br>\nA video can be seen here:\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtQ2Yo-lDig\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtQ2Yo-lDig</a>",
