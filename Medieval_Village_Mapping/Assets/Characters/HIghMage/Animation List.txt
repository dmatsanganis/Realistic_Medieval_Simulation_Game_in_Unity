FORMATS & ANIMATIONS
All model formats with 'm' prefixed have the following multitrack animations - That is, that they are listed in your 3d
engine ready to use with names.  DIrecet X and FBX supports this, and various engines can use such formats, such as UNITY 3d.


FACIAL FEATURE CONTROL
There is also an animation EYEBLINK which demonstates a simple eyeblining animation

Eyeblinking forms part of most animations
Mouth movement is indcluded in most animations, as subtle movement, to add realism.

I will also supply a version of this model without any eye or mouth control, so you the user, can take charge of this in your game.
